http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10488v1;Does an artificial intelligence perform market manipulation with its own discretion? -- A genetic algorithm learns in an artificial market simulation;Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence performing market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation.;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10488v1;artificial;12345678900
http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02924v1;The Governance of Physical Artificial Intelligence;Physical artificial intelligence can prove to be one of the most important challenges of the artificial intelligence. The governance of physical artificial intelligence would define its responsible intelligent application in the society.;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02924v1;artificial;12345678900
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12076v1;Perspective: Purposeful Failure in Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence;"Complex systems fail. I argue that failures can be a blueprint characterizing living organisms and biological intelligence, a control mechanism to increase complexity in evolutionary simulations, and an alternative to classical fitness optimization. Imitating biological successes in Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence can be misleading; imitating failures offers a path towards understanding and emulating life it in artificial systems.";http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12076v1;artificial;12345678900

The implementation of the artificial chemistry and first results of statistical experiments are presented.;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.1534v1;artificial;12345678900
http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01213v1;Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Theory;Artificial intelligence has impacted many aspects of human life. This paper studies the impact of artificial intelligence on economic theory. In particular we study the impact of artificial intelligence on the theory of bounded rationality, efficient market hypothesis and prospect theory.;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01213v1;artificial;12345678900
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02179v1;The case for psychometric artificial general intelligence;A short review of the literature on measurement and detection of artificial general intelligence is made. Proposed benchmarks and tests for artificial general intelligence are critically evaluated against multiple criteria. Based on the findings, the most promising approaches are identified and some useful directions for future work are proposed.;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02179v1;artificial;12345678900
